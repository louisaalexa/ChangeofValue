On the Freedom of Choice




In his 1996 novel Infinite Jest!, David Foster Wallace describes The Entertainment: A film so entertaining, everyone who watches it is unable to stop and eventually dies. The film is distributed in what is declared a terrorist attack on the Organization of North American Nations, a dystopian superstate of boarding schools and Narcotics- and Alcoholics Anonymous, reaching from Canada to Mexico. In conversation, one character argues that The Entertainment poses a threat to humanity's freedom, while another asks how one can ever be free without learning to have the freedom to choose.  
Over the past centuries, we have built our governments around the idea of the freedom of choice. In liberal classicism, or what we call ‘The Free World’, our personal freedoms are guaranteed as our civil liberties, while the degree of how far these liberties are enforced by the state or ourselves is reliant on our representative government, and we, the people, are free to choose this representation. Yet, when it comes to money, which is our medium of exchange, our store of value, and our unit of accounting, and therefore essential in realizing our freedoms however they may be permitted, the ability to choose our own sovereignty over the state’s grows limited. The question is how free a society can be when it’s most vital tool to act on its freedom is not.
Before being a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit for accounting, money is a social agreement that is made between individuals to simplify trade. Like any agreement, money comes with rules and constraints, which must be enforceable. After the Austrian thought, a school of economics that is growing in prominence again today, each individual should be able to enter and execute such agreements self-responsibly. The problem is that, when trade outgrows local reach, the efficiency of self-enforcement is minimized through physical distance. Over time, we have therefore needed to develop central institutions entrusted with the task of enforcing the rules of our money for us (Bettina Warburg, The Blockchain Revolution, 2017). 
These public institutions of Western democracies are today governed by elected representatives, whom citizens entrust the task of making decisions for them. These decisions must first and foremost be based on the people's personal freedoms, which are guaranteed as civil liberties. These are, for example, equality before the courts, security of property, the freedom of thought and its expression, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press and religion, and the freedom to assemble. In the case of money, we entrust representatives to ensure our economic and political freedom, which is a civil liberty guaranteed by liberal classicism in particular. No decision a representative makes may ever restrict these rights. 
History has however shown that economic or political crises often lead to capital controls. People can be made subject to arbitrary regulations, as seen recently during the Greek financial crisis, when ATM withdrawals were limited to 67 € per day per card. At the same time, countries are struggling to ensure financial inclusion as seen in the US, where 18% of the population do not have access to a bank account. That is 60 million people, in the United States alone, who do not have access to any financial services (A. Antonopoulos, Universal Basic Finance, 2019). The right of the people to economic and political freedom is, in these cases, restricted. 


‘Always with you this freedom! For your walled-up country, always to shout “Freedom! Freedom!” as if it were obvious to all people what it wants to mean, this word. But look: it is not so simple as that. Your freedom is the freedom-from: no one tells your precious individual U.S.A. selves what they must do. It is this meaning only, this freedom from constraint and forced duress. ––– ‘But what of the freedom-to? Not just free-from. Not all compulsion comes from without. You pretend you do not see this. What of the freedom-to? How for the person to freely choose? How to choose any but a child’s greedy choices if there is no loving-filled father to guide, inform, teach the person how to choose?’


In Wallace’s novel, Steeply, a US undercover agent for the Department of Unspecified Services, suspects the Quebecois nationalist Marathe to be supporting the separatists cause of distributing the so-entertaining-it-kills-you film. Steeply sees this as a terroristic act, which threatens not just the freedom of the citizens of the Organization of North American Nations, but the freedom of all humanity. Marathe, however, sees this differently. What Steeply sees as weak and contemptible – Traits Steeply wants to see citizens protected of – Marathe rather sees as ‘the hazards of being free’. 
In the governance of money, our freedoms are broadly treated as a freedom-‘from’. As an example, take the freedom-‘from’ needing to individually account for, administer or store one‘s own capital. Without the freedom-‘from’ accounting for one's own capital, individuals would fall back to a barter economy in which goods are exchanged as commodity money, because there would be no universal unit of exchange in place. Without the freedom-‘from’ administering one‘s own capital, individuals would fall back to trading locally, because one would not be able to enforce transactions without being in direct reach. Without the freedom-‘from’ storing one's own capital, individuals would need to protect their own money physically, which would likely cause big parts of society to fall victim to anarcho-capitalism. These freedoms-‘from’ allow people to participate in the global economy, which analogues to their freedom-‘to’. This freedom-to is however no freedom at all if we are unable to choose otherwise. 
Try to think about it like this: As individuals, we form societies by giving up some of our freedoms in exchange for convenience or security. Taking as a natural state the assumption that all individuals are free because each individual is responsible for everything they do (J.P. Sartre, Being and Nothingness, Pt. 4, Chapter 2, 1943), we must ask what freedoms and, hence, responsibilities, individuals are willing to give up to form a society, and how the resulting political and economic decision power can be organized. Going back to understanding money as a social agreement that is made to simplify trade between individuals, it becomes clear that the word ‘agreement’ has little to do with the way we govern our money today – Because, to enter an agreement, participants involved need to be sufficiently informed. We now find ourselves in a logical dilemma when seen from the point that we cannot choose what we do not know.
