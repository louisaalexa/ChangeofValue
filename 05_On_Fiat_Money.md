On Fiat Money


The term ‘fiat’ can be translated from Latin to ‘It shall be’ or ‘Let it be done’, as in ‘Fiat Lux’ – ‘Let there be light’. Fiat money, also called fiduciary money (latin fidere = to trust), has no intrinsic value. It is not backed by scarce commodities, like the goldsmith’s receipts or the pegged US Dollar were equal to amounts of hard money or gold, but by the evaluation of how trustworthy the governance of the money itself appears. E.g.: A merchant only accepts US Dollars because one believes that a substantial amount of other merchants will accept these US Dollars in exchange for goods and services in the future. The more people trust that the governance of the US Dollar is efficient in storing value over time to exchange goods and services with a substantial amount of people, the more people buy US Dollar on the foreign exchange market or demand to be paid in US Dollar, and the more US Dollar are printed. If a pegged US Dollar stands for an equal amount of gold, which is a purchasing power that is somewhat definable, a floating US Dollar equals a big fat question mark.  
The concept of fiat money – money that is not backed by precious metals or hard money, but by the sole promise of a bank to disburse its value – was first introduced in Stockholm in 1657 by a Latvian-born Dutch banker named Johan Palmstruch. Palmstruch, who was ordered to found the Stockholm Banco by King Gustav X to setup a banking system similar to the ones present in merchant cities as London, Hamburg and Amsterdam at the time, where banks offered interchangeable receipts as the goldsmith’s ones for hard money in storage, made an unprecedented discovery: Most of the money held in his bank would go substantial periods of time without actually being claimed by anyone. Palmstruch hence began giving out amounts of unused customer funds as credits to businesses, which worked well until the Swedish crown ordered all hard money to be returned to the state for reformation – only to discover that Palmstruch had lent out almost all of the hard money at hand. In turn, Palmstruch needed to come up with an idea that would allow him to give back the lent out hard money without bankrupting the businesses, and quick. In consequence, Palmstruch decided to decouple his bank notes from the hard money in store, instead promising their holders payment in silver; This money was called Kreditsvedlar. And again, the funds deposited were rarely claimed, allowing Palmstruch to continue issuing loans. What at the time arguably nobody saw coming was that Palmstruch and his Stockholm Banco were steadily increasing the Swedish’ economies money supply; The Kreditsvedlar began to decrease in purchasing power, which led to an increase in prices. When this was noticed, the Stockholm Banco began cutting down on its loan issuance much to the dismay of its customers, who were now faced with a liquidity squeeze. By 1667, people wanted to give back their Kreditsvedlar in exchange for the silver promised, which they could not, because Palmstruch had – again – lent it all away. 
The moral of the story could now be to not trust money that’s based on loans, but instead, the Swedish crown came to the conclusion that such money simply needed to be issued under more precise governmental oversight. With this, the Stockholm Banco was renamed Sveriged Riskbank in 1668 and became the first bank in the world that issued paper money in the name of a government, which was the birth of fiat money. To compare, both the Nota di Banco and the goldsmith’s receipts were backed by legal tender – the money that had to be accepted within a state or nation, as gold, silver or hard money – but the notes themselves remained issued by private institutions. With this, Palmstruch’s Stockholm Banco became the first private bank to issue bank notes on behalf of a government’s decree and trust. Essentially Palmstruchs Stockholm Banco laid the foundations for the world's first central bank, the Central Bank of Sweden, which remains active to this day under its new name, the Svergied Riskbank; While Palmstruch himself was sentenced to death for financial fraud and later pardoned on behalf of the Swedish crown.
