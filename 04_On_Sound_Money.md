1.1 On Sound Money


‘It is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe we would have a revolution before tomorrow morning.’


Henry Ford, 1957


In an article titled How Internationalists Gain Power, that appeared in The American Mercury in 1957, steel mogul Henry Ford is quoted to have said in substance that ‘It is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe we would have a revolution before tomorrow morning’ – Simply for the fact that people trust money that is backed by specific things more than a money backed by something to exist in the future. Ford knew this even in advance of the great stock-market boom in the 1920’s and the following great depression, as is stated in his adapted autobiography My Life and Work from 1922. It reads that ‘people are on the sound side of money. They are so unalterably on the sound side of money that it is a serious question how they would regard the system under which they live, if they once knew what the initiate can do with it’. And if we are honest, today, almost 100 years later, we still don’t have the utter of a clue. In the next three chapters, we will therefore take a closer look at how different types of money have been issued throughout history.

Money is an intangible object that can take on various forms. That‘s why, when you ask people what money is, you will probably get a lot of very different answers. Money as the term itself has no greater definition – Rather, it is defined by a series of functions. The first and foremost function of a money is that it is able to act as a medium of exchange, used to exchange goods and services. If you accept cobblestones as payment, cobblestones are money. If you accept rice corns as payment, rice corns are money. In fact, anything that is accepted as payment can, in theory, be defined as money. Now that‘s confusing, right? 
If anything can be money, we need to define which money is ‘good’; e.g. works well within the framework of an economic system – and which money is ‘bad’; e.g. does not work well within the framework of an economic system. This is where a money’s other two functions come into play: acting as a store of value and a unit of account. 
Whether a money is considered ‘good’ or ‘bad’ – and hence able to become a universal medium of exchange – is  dependent on how well it executes all three functions combined. 
For example, nobody is going to accept cobblestones as payment, because cobblestones aren’t scarce; they can be found on every street, which is why it is unlikely for anyone to exchange goods for them. Cobblestones are hence a bad store of value. There are, however, other stones that we can use as a store of value, like diamonds or precious jewels. Both are rare, but would we call them money? Imagine a friend asking you to lend them money, and you turn up with some quartz; A precious stone valued at 290 EUR per 0,0300g at the time of writing. That could be a good amount of money, but how in the world are they supposed to pay their bills with a sack full of expensive rocks? 
Gold, silver and other precious metals, on the other hand, make for much better units of accounting, as they can be melted and reformed into smaller units. That’s why, around 1000 BC, the first coinage – precious metals brought into uniform – was developed and adapted as currency – The main medium of money used to purchase goods and services in an economy – in Lybia, modern day Turkey, called Electrum. But, gold, silver and other precious metals, as well as hard money, as in any form of coinage, are heavy to transport. This is a problem when large amounts of money are meant to be exchanged over far distances.
 Paper money is much easier to carry – The problem being that it has no intrinsic value; It’s just a piece of paper. Paper money was first introduced by the Chinese emperor Hien Tsung (806-821), although it was not derived out of any great financial insight; The sole reason for its introduction was a copper shortage that impeded the striking of new coins. Tsung’s version of paper money was however so easy to produce that too much of it was printed on the regular, which led to continuous periods of hyperinflation – a drastic decrease in a money's purchasing power causing prices to rise – until it was finally abandoned almost 900 years later, in 1455. 
By the 14th century the Italians took on the idea of paper money to create the first bank note, the ‘Nota di Banco’. The Italian ‘Nota di Banco’ was a so-called promissory note: It represented a legally binding promise to pay a certain amount of precious metals or hard money held in a bank at fixed terms in the future, while holders of the bank note had the right to collect this money from the bank. The Italian’s paper money worked much better than Tsung’s paper money because it was backed by commodities, like hard money or gold. With the invention of the Nota di Banco the Italians also created the first double-ledger system, which is still used in banking today – a way to issue money that would allow the bank to keep track of debits and withdrawals. 
The Nota di Banco was quickly adapted throughout Europe, but it had the problem that it wasn’t very easily interchangeable; It was more a cheque-like instrument that always needed to be issued in someone's name; And anyone who’s been to Starbucks knows how that can go wrong. Because of this deficiency, the Nota di Banco was radically re-thought by a group of English goldsmiths by the 16th century. While goldsmiths aren’t bankers, they do possess somewhat the same means as banks to store and manage supplies of gold. Goldsmiths hence began to take gold in storage and offer receipts which were not issued in someone's name, and could therefore be interchanged much easier. Both the Nota di Banco and the goldsmith’s receipts represent what we call sound money, which has been used by most societies throughout history: A money that is backed by commodities which are limited in supply. The US Dollar, for example, was broadly backed by its equivalent in gold until 1971; This is called a fixed or pegged exchange rate. That meant every US Dollar the Federal Reserve issued directly represented an amount of gold in their vaults, so people did not need to run around with actual gold in their pockets. So far, so understandable.
