In late 2018 the artist Simon Denny curated a Show titled Proof of Work at Berlin's Schinkel Pavillon. In its center stood a work by the French collective Distributed Gallery – A tall wooden, glass and iron lined box, that at first glance appeared to be something of a mix between a jukebox and a toaster. Around it stood at least 20 people. The Chaos Machine, as it was fittingly titled, turned out to be a machine to burn your money; Visitors could insert Euro bills through its money slot which fell into the glass box and onto an iron grill burning the notes, while the Machine played a random selection of Chopin and Eminem. 
A few weeks later the artists got in touch: Whether we knew of a place to store the work for a couple of days after the show had ended? Room77, the first brick-and-mortar business to accept bitcoin in the world, was the first place that came to mind. 




„There are these artists from France and they need a place to store a machine in Berlin for a couple of days, it’s pretty big, around 180x60x60cm – Do you have space?“
„No. …. .“
„But it burns your money!“
„Ah, of course, we got all the space you need, just let me know where you wanna have it!“




Seen from a legal standpoint, burning money is a tricky thing. And as the first brick-and-mortar business to accept bitcoin, Room77 has had its fair share of troubles with financial regulators in its previous 10 years of existence. Fortunately, whether burning money is legal depends on the jurisdiction in which the money is issued, and in the EU, burning the Euro is totally fine. Another week later the machine was delivered, and The Chaos Machine did its name all the justice. There was not a single time money could be burned without somebody losing their marbles. Some nights people burned up to 300 Euro. Others left infuriated, pledging to never step foot in a place like this ever again. A few people even began burning money without the machine, holding Euro notes over lit candles while singing their own songs along; They called it analogue Chaos. It felt as though we had unleashed a monster. 
Part bar part hacker space, Room77 brought together an interesting range of views of why The Chaos Machine should be hailed to Satan. There were the Socialists: (‚That’s all Money we could invest in Health Care!‘); The Anti-Statists (That’s all Money you could have given a person in need!“); The Capitalists (‚You could have given that Money to me!“); And the occasional drunk („I could buy myself another beer with this money!“). On the other, proposing side of The Chaos Machine stood the other occasional drunk: („Burn all my Money!“); As well as the local Room77 Bitcoiners: („That isn’t Money!“); And a few Etherians („Does this run on Ethereum?“). 
What was it about money that made us all go crazy? And why on earth would anyone ever want to burn it? 
These were questions the British artists collective 2K were faced with as well, following their 1997 video performance K Foundation: Burning One Million Quid – in which they literally set fire to 1 Million Pound Sterling. 
2K are Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, who have had their fair share of success in the music industry. As K Foundation, 2K retired from the music scene and presented what was meant to be a series of sculptures, titled Money: A Major Body of Cash. The first work, called Nailed to a Wall, consisted of 1 Million GBP in 50 pound notes nailed to a board, and was meant to be offered at a sales price of 500.000 GBP. Unfortunately no gallery took interest in their artistic practice, which may well be due to the fact that anyone defacing the GBP may be fined with a criminal offence in the UK. Instead, 2K decided to burn the money and record the act on Super 8 film. 
On The Late Late Show in 1995, Gay Byrne got to ask Drummond and Cauty why. Their answer was that they haven’t got a definitive answer for him. Their answers could change just as their ideas would change; In fact, they had just come up with a new answer to why the day before the interview, but it may very well be a different one tomorrow. Byrne follows up: 




“What kind of weird people are you?”     




Drummond answers calmly. ‘See, if we’d gone and spent the money on tools or Rolls Royces, I don’t think anyone would be upset. It’s because we burned it that they’re upset. The thing is… Us burning that money doesn’t mean there’s any less loaves of bread in the world or any less apples; There is nothing less in the world. The only thing that’s less is a pile of paper.’ 
Could these two guys be right? Is all that money really only paper? Let us at this point only take so far away: The answer is yes. Fiat money, which is the money used throughout most societies today, does not have any inherent worth; It’s just a piece of paper. In fact, it is so much just a piece of paper that it is sometimes even by governments still treated as such – The Bank of England, for example, heated its premises by burning paper bills in their basement until the 1990s, while the European Central Bank offers laminated bricks of shredded paper notes worth one million Euro for the price of 15,-; As a souvenir.

The day the Chaos Machine arrived fell on the same day as the ten year genesis block anniversary – The day the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain was mined. Joerg Platzer, owner of Room77 and cypherpunk of the very first age, had been laying out leaflets: ‘Save the Euro by burning some! If we burn as man millions heree at night as Draghi prints at daytime, we may save ourselves from hyperinglation!’ they read. At the time, Mario Draghi, Head of the ECB, had been printing 54 million new Euro per month. In theory, this  newly printed money decreases the purchasing power of all other money in circulation. To Platzer, the Chaos Machine, or ‘Anti-Inflation Machine’ as he liked to call it, burning money was a form of protest. It demonstrated the rights of Central Banks to determine the purchasing power of fiat money over the average person’s: When private people burn their fiat money, their own purchasing power decreases. The purchasing power of the rest of the fiat money in circulation, however, will remain unchanged, as Central Banks will just reprint the money burned. 
Money burning, in the theoretical sense, is employed by Central Banks all the time when regulating the money supply. Try to think about it like this: When Central Banks burn money, the purchasing power of the rest of the money in circulation increases. In an Episode titled Cash Burning Machines Max Keiser of the Keiser Report – An ex-Wall Street broker turned BBC World News and Russia Today reporter, who has become known to light paper bills on fire – says about money burning: 




        “This is essentially what’s driving the economy – It’s burning cash; And it’s a beautiful thing, because it doesn’t cost anything.”




What Keiser is referring to is that Central Banks may print as much fiat money as they like. The only thing that is stopping them are the risks of inflation - a decrease in a fiat money’s purchasing power due to too much money in the economy. According to Keiser, printing fiat money today does not cost anything – i.e. does not cause inflation – because the broad portion of the newly printed money never reaches the real economy. It is rather distributed in stages, reaching those closest to the money printing press first, who then burn the bigger portion of the money in so-called zombie companies s.a. WeWork and Uber.  This type of money burning does however increase the prices of realty (in the case of WeWork) and decreases the wages of cab drivers (in the case of Uber). What sounds like a conspiracy theory is called the Cantillon Effect, and has occurred in all centrally issued currencies to date. 
We have by now established two things: For one, that burning fiat money can only effectively be employed by a dedicated number of people, and second, that when such parties engage in money burning, certain baskets of goods increase in prices for the rest of us. This leads us to one of the  central questions of this book: How has the power to issue different types of money been used in the past, and what consequences has the enactment of such power had on society throughout history?
Fact is that, ever since the development of nation states, all types of money have been needed to clear through central institutions, with dedicated laws and penalties in place to ensure the compliance of their people. Laws which have been based around religion, race and citizenship, as is the case today. Laws that, at last in times of globalisation and the WorldWideWeb appear somewhat outdated. 
Now the good news is that we don’t live in the middle ages anymore. The bad news is, however, that it doesn’t really feel like we’ve taken our understanding of money along. In fact, while money as an technology has advanced from Automatic Teller Machines to Credit Cards and Cryptocurrencies, roughly six out of ten people burning money in the Chaos Machine at Room77 believed today’s Euro, US Dollar and/or Pound Sterling were still pegged to gold (or other types of precious metals)(They are not). 
In our now almost three years with the Chaos Machine, we observed that everyone seemed to have their own idea of money. To some it was a vehicle to store their time spent working, to some a vehicle to invest, to others a line of debt and credit. The thing is that there is no universal definition of money; Money is an intangible object that can take on various forms. The problem is that no adequate discussion can be held if the terms argued are not defined; With the Chaos Machine in Room77, this often manifested in everyone screaming at everyone. The second observation we made was that we can’t choose what we don’t know; Leaving us to wonder how we could base our entire lives around something we knew almost nothing about. The value of the Chaos Machine to us was therefore that every time we burned money, we learned a little bit more about money. It is these learnings that will serve us as a guideline throughout this book.
